# PubSubNet spec

architecture description and specification of the PubSubNet content / "social" networking protocol, extending WebSub's specific Publish/Subscribe model

**this repository currently has ideas and non-normative descriptions**, taken from my notes, of the very first revision of the specification and / or protocol. it is not yet a specification or declaration of features.

PubSubNet aims to replace Twitter, Facebook, and similar centralised profit-oriented social media, by putting users in control of their social network. Personal data is stored on your device locally, and only content you choose is uploaded to the Hubs for others to see.

The name, PubSubNet, means "publish/subscribe network", but is subject to change because it is silly, and because PSN is a trademark of Sony.
